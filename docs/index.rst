    This is the main page of the documentation, created via `Sphinx`_. Please
    note that these are written in `reStructuredText`_ (RST).

    Pages can be added by creating separate .rst files and listing them in the
    toctree below. By default, an example for a page on installation is shown.
    The module reference is also included, which, via the autodoc extension,
    will include documentation from docstrings. Note that docstrings should
    be written in `NumPy style`_ format.
