    "# Virtual Hospital walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual hospital environment comprises several components that can be tailored to mimic any arbitrary hospital structure, allowing the user to test the allocation agents at different scales. It is based on a tree-like structure using the [anytree library](https://pypi.org/project/anytree/) to define the hierarchical structure of a hospital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The user can build virtual hospitals containing the desired number of wards, rooms and beds. In addition, the virtual hospital encodes the allocation restrictions and associated penalties that apply to the hospital, as well as the data structure for patients. We have encoded different types of ward (medical, surgical) and rooms (bed bays, side rooms) to cater for a broad range of allocation rules. In addition, certain restrictions apply specifically to a patient and are thus contained within the patient class (e.g. if a patient requires a sideroom).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to create a hospital object. The hospital will consist of 4 medical wards and 2 surgical wards as detailed below. Within each ward we will add a number of rooms (bed bays and side rooms) as well as ward and room restrictions. We will then save this hospital object to reuse in subsequent notebooks and the UI.In the second half of the notebook we demonstrate how to admit and discharge patients from the hospital, and calculate the associated penalties. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Import required modules\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ you will need to first install the module as per the instructions in the main [README](../README.md), and run a notebook server from within the same virtual environment to have access to the `hospital` submodules."
