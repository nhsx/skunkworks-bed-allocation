    "Greedy optimisation finds the best allocation currently available given the state of the hospital and attributes of the patient. Consider the following example:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>A female adult medical patient has arrived at the hospital and there are only two available beds. The first is within a bed bay of the male medical ward, the second is within a bed bay of a female surgical ward.\n",
    "<li>According to user research the penalty for assigning a patient to ward with incorrect sex is 10 whilst the penalty for assigning a medical patient to a surgical ward is 3. \n",
    "<li>The greedy algorithm would choose the second bed, finding the solution that incurs the lowest penalty.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more complicated scenario, where multiple penalties of varying cost may apply, it will optimise for the lowest aggregated penalty, which is a balance between the number of constraints broken and the magnitude of their costs i.e., breaking 1 constraint at a cost of 10 is worse than breaking 2 with a total cost of 7. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is called ‘greedy’ as it performs a brute force search across all available options. This may be slow if the size of your search space (e.g. number of possible choices) is very large.\n",
